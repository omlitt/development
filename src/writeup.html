		<p>
			The goal of this project was to use the React framework to build a website that has filtering, sorting, and aggregation capabilities. I chose to build a website for a fictional Car Dealership.

		</p>
		<p><a>Website</a></p>
		<p><a>Github Repository</a></p>
		<h2 id='s'>React Website</h2>
		
		<img class="banner" src="screenshot.png">
		<p>The website has a predefined list of 12 vehichles that the user can browse. The user can filter by color, size, and sort by price. Any combination of these actions is supported. The user can add the items to their cart in any quantity, and the total price of the cart is calculated and displayed. </p>
		
		<h2 id='design'>Design</h2>
		<p>While visual design was not the focus of this project, usability is still very important. Radio buttons were chosen for the filters because it is established that a user can only choose one of the options out of the set. </p>
		<p>Another design decision I made was to only allow users to change the quantity of items in the cart one at a time by pressing the buttons. Since users are buying cars which are mostly very expensive, being able to change the cart in increments of larger than one is not nescessarily in the user's best interest.</p>
		<h2 id='take'>Takeaways</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>React is a very powerful framework, and it made the implementation of this project a breeze.</li>
			<li>Because of the seamless integration between React components and HTML elements, there is a high level of consolidation when developing in React.</li>
		</ul>
